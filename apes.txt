----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Example

	Humans are an example of a biological species that has evolved

	Possibly of interest, since many of your friends are probably humans

	Humans seem unique:

		How do they differ from other evolved organisms?

		What do they share with other evolved organisms?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarities and differences

	What is different about people?

		ANS Complex thoughts

		ANS Culture

		ANS Language

		ANS Technology

	What is the same?

		ANS We're here because our ancestors reproduced

		ANS If reproductive success depends on heritable variation in traits
		\ldots

			ANS We're still evolving

			ANS Directional selection? Varying selection?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Patterns of evolution

----------------------------------------------------------------------

History

	There are a _lot_ of steps (and a lot of divergences) between us and the
	last universal common ancestor of life

	More than 3 billion years ago!

	Some key steps:

		[Eukaryotes]

		[Animals]

		[Vertebrates]

		[Mammals]

		[Primates]

		[Apes]

Timeline | Table 9.1

	Why not just say how long ago?

		Periods may be punctuated by major events

			* Radiations, mass extinctions

		People started talking about periods before they had good measures of how
		long ago things happened

		Periods have cool names

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Context for evolution

	Adaptations build on existing adaptations -- often in unexpected ways

	Evolution does not know where it's going

	In a constant environment, we would have to imagine a species just getting
	better and better adapted to that environment

		and never getting stuck, e.g. vertebrate eyes

	A changing environment provides opportunities to try new combinations and
	build in unexpected directions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Physical changes

	Physical changes often provide species with new adaptive challenges and
	opportunities:

	Global climate change

	Continental drift

	Geological changes

		New environments can arise (e.g., mountain ranges, desert basins)

		Geology may also change connections between two populations without a
		large effect on how they live

			Rivers changing course

			Mountain ranges separating valley species

			ANS Provides opportunities for allopatric speciation

Changing ecosystems

	Taxa can be dramatically affected by changes in other taxa

		Due to evolution or to colonization

	Interactions with other organisms are key to most ecological niches

		Who do I eat? Who is trying to eat me? How do I reproduce?

	Co-evolution is a key driver of diversity. For example:

		Plants evolve new ways to use insects for sex, or vertebrates for
		dispersal

		Animals evolve new ways to benefit from plant resources

SS Patterns of diversity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Therapsids | p. 211

	Our ancestors radiated and dominated many terrestrial environments _before_
	dinosaurs did

		I have no idea why the book refers to therapsids as reptiles; it seems
		very wrong:

			ANS If they were, then we are

			ANS One better name would be tetrapods

	Therapsids were largely replaced by dinosaurs in the age of dinosaurs

		But some survived, and one radiated after a mass extinction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Radiation and contraction

	Many clades seem to go through periods of radiation and contraction

		Gain and then loss of species diversity

	Examples:

		Therapsids, apes, hominins (us)

		NOANS

	Radiation gives many chances for adaptation

		Things that have had radiations may be more likely to persist

		Even after periods of contraction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reasons for contraction

	Why might a clade diversify and then suffer many extinctions?

		ANS Changing conditions (climate change, continents moving)

		ANS Competition from other clades (apes vs.~monkeys)

		ANS Competition from a successful member (people vs.~other hominins)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Observer bias

	One reason we see a lot of clades with a history of radiations may be that
	those clades are the ones we're looking at

		ANS The clades that are still around

	Clades with a history of radiation may be more successful

		They've explored more kinds of environments

		They're found in more different specific places

			e.g., marsupials in Australia

		They've had more chances to adapt

			May have a few very successful species (like us)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC The evolution of primates | pp.~251--267

	Humans are [primates], an ``order" characterized by

		Grasping hands and feet

		Nails and fingertips (instead of claws)

		Highly developed [stereroscopic] vision

			Eyes are close together, face forward, and are used together

			Allows 3-d visualization

		Hind-limb dominance

		Large brains

Traits | Freeman Fig 34.40

	What sort of traits to biologists use to characterize a group?

		ANS Derived traits

	How would you interpret the fact that humans don't have grasping
	feet?

		ANS Secondary loss

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The angiosperm explosion

	Flowering plants diversified very rapidly around 100 [mya] --
	million years ago

	This radically changed the ecology of the world, and opened up many
	new niches, apparently including space for primates

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Primate adaptations

	There are a variety of theories for how characteristic primate
	adaptations evolved

	Each step was likely favored adaptively

	Likely something to do with processing and handling angiosperm fruit
	and flowers

		Or else the insects that fed on these fruit and flowers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Adaptive theories

	There are many theories for why primate traits might have been adaptively
	favored in our ancestors

		Leaping from branch to branch

		Climbing and balancing on trees

		Exploiting new plant resources

		Catching insects

		[Adaptive foraging]: the ability to switch between types of food, and to
		learn to use new types of food

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Patterns of adaptation

	These strategies may have evolved sequentially

		Maybe exploiting tree resources came first, but similar traits helped
		some species later catch insects

		Maybe traits evolved for one specific purpose later became useful for
		adaptive foraging

			CORRECTION *which evolved

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sociality

	A big component of fitness may be based on co-operating with (or at least
	being tolerated by) [conspecifics] -- other members of your species

	Brains that evolved for complicated foraging may have also been useful for
	social skills

	Looping: once sociality was present, adaptation for social thinking and
	thinking about food may have interacted to increase selection for brain size

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Tools for learning about the past

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting fed

	A major factor in adaptation is food source.

	The most important strategies for early primates were:
	
		[Frugivory]: eating fruits (and sometimes flowers)

		[Folivory]: eating leaves

		[Insectivory]: eating insects

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth | Fig 9.15

	Teeth are very important for processing food

	Why do we have wisdom teeth?

		ANS An adaptation to make it more likely we will have functional teeth in
		middle age

		ANS This is probably also why we have two sets of teeth

	Teeth help scientists understand what extinct animals ate

		Well preserved, highly adapted

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Eyes 

	Eye [orbits] are the skeletal cavities where eyes are

	Orbits tell us size, shape and position of eyes from fossil animals

	What are the advantages and disadvantages of more forward-facing eyes?

		ANS Better for precise tasks, three-dimensional visualization

		ANS Not as good for looking around, being alert

	What are the advantages and disadvantages of larger eyes?

		ANS Better for night vision

		ANS More costly? Better for day vision?

Sexual dimorphism

	Information about differences between males and females has implications
	about social structure and mating patterns

		In species where there is more variation in male success (less bonding in
		pairs), we expect:

			ANS More sexual dimorphism

			ANS More competition between males for females

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WIDEPIC webpix/gorillas.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WIDEPIC webpix/bonobos.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dimorphism and sexual strategies

	Gorillas live in male-centered groups (one adult male, several adult females)

	Chimpanzees live in large, well-mixed groups with lots of interactions
	between males and females

	Which species should have more sexual dimorphism overall?

		ANS Gorillas. Males are huge and strong and compete for females by displaying and fighting. A dominant male has exclusive access to a group of females

	Which species should have larger male genitals?

		ANS Chimpanzees have much larger genitals.
		
		ANS Gorillas don't use genitals as part of sexual competition

	What about humans?

Interpreting fossil traits

	There is lots of ongoing debate about relationships between extinct primates
	| pp.218-220, 226-228, elsewhere

	We know a lot know about omomyids and adapids

	How do we not know how they relate to modern primates?

		ANS Convergent evolution


----------------------------------------------------------------------

What was where when? | Fig 9.19

	When are two specimens from the same species?

	How do we learn clues to tell _sexes_ apart, and recognize which dimorphic
	individuals are from the same species?

	How do we know what fossils we \emph{didn't} find?

BCC

	[Anthropoids] is the sub-group of primates including apes and monkeys

		ANS Monkeys are not a clade!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ape adaptations | p.228

	Apes are more adapted for swinging through trees, whereas monkeys
	are more adapted for climbing and leaping

	More upright

	Better at hanging, and worse at sitting

	Lots of missing pieces of the puzzle

		There may be a lot of convergent evolution and secondary loss going on

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Patterns of replacement

	Apes ``radiated" into many habitats before monkeys did

		Many ape species were apparently later replaced by monkeys

	Why might apes have diversified, and later been replaced by monkeys?

		ANS Changing climactic conditions



		ANS Probably no people

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

	People have important differences from other organisms

	We got here using the same rules of natural selection as everyone else

		Things may be different _now_, but even that is not so clear

	Adaptation does not move in a straight line

		Changing conditions lead to opportunities for new adaptations

		New adaptations _themselves_ can be an important cause of changing
		conditions

			Innovations, or co-evolution with other taxa

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Learning about evolution

	Understanding the course of evolution is an important part of understanding
	how things work now

		How organisms work, and how ecosystems work

	There are many challenges:

		Timelines, identification, convergent evolution
