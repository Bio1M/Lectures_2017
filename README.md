Installation
============

* Clone or fork [this repo](https://github.com/Bio1M/Lectures)
* Install the 1M images Dropbox folder somewhere:
	* (Default is ~/Dropbox/1M/)
	* Otherwise, create a file called `local.mk` and say `imagefiles = <dirpath>`
* execute:
```
make Makefile
make makestuff
make imagelinks
```

Operation
=========

The idea is to edit .txt files, which can then be made into various products:
* `draft.pdf` files for preparing lectures.
* `outline.pdf` files just show outline information. Sometimes useful when preparing lectures, but I rarely use them.
* `handouts.pdf` files are for the kids to print and take notes on
* `final.pdf` files have lots of automatic pauses for final lectures; people who like to wander and teach may not like them.
* `pause.pdf` is an alternative, with only minimal pauses (for example, when you want to ask a question for students to answer). _It does not exist in any form,_ but would be a good idea.
* `complete.pdf` is the handouts with answers and comments filled in. It's meant for student reference after the unit is completed.

The `txt` files are writing in dmu (dumb markup). This is a legacy holdover, poorly documented, but very useful for those (me) who are used to it. I will work on documentation if requested. The dmu engine is controlled by `.fmt` files which are in turn made automatically (in this project) from `.format` files. The format file txt.format is possibly a little useful for figuring out the .txt files, should that be desired. Happy to talk more about this.

The other main things I do from here are to push products automatically either to git_push (so I can download and show them in class) or to the associated github-pages repo.

It may also be worth talking about whether you would find the image getting and recording machinery worth using: right now it's set up for you to use images I've already put in dropbox, but it should be easy to enable automatic downloading to dropbox. Or maybe that's stupidâ€¦

Next year
=========

* Look for activities in each section

* More about scaling?
