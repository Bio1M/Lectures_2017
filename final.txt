Evaluating competing hypotheses

	We challenge hypotheses with experiments and observation

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance of acquired characteristics

	This is the idea that individuals change in response to their
	environment, and pass those changes on to their offspring

		Example: giraffes reaching for food

	It is now known that while individuals do often change in response
	to their environment, such changes are not (usually) passed on to
	offspring

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inheritance of acquired characteristics vs.~natural selecton

	Raise several populations of mice in the lab

	In the acquired group, every generation stretch (or chop off) their poor
	little tails

	In the selection group, every generation, allow mice with longer (or
	shorter) tails more chances to breed

	In the control group, do everything the same (including manipulations)

		ANS Except the part that is the key to treatment

	Measure natural tail length at the beginning of the experiment, and
	after 100 generations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal-directed evolution

	This is the idea that organisms evolve towards specific goals

		Complex, multicellular organisms

		Big-brained humans

	If the organism is moving toward a goal, it should move more or less in that
	direction all the time

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal-directed evolution

	There is a great deal of observational evidence against
	goal-directed evolution:

		Vestigial traits

		Bidirectional evolution

			Finch beaks get larger, then smaller

			Birds gain, then lose, flying ability

			Things that become parasites may become much smaller and
			simpler

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The good of the species

	Selection operates on individuals; individuals are not adapted to act
	for the good of the species

	The evolution of co-operation always involves tension between what is
	good for the group, and what is good for the individual

		If `cheating' strategies can evolve, they will

		A [cheater] benefits from co-operation, but does not participate

	Individuals are usually selected to act for themselves, sometimes for the
	group, and rarely or ever for the species

Example: calculating allele frequencies

	I collect 20 peppered moths from a particular place, and find that 4
	have genotype $A_1	A_1$, 8 have genotype $A_1	A_2$, and 8 have
	genotype $A_2	A_2$.

	What is the observed frequency of each allele?

	What is the expected frequency of each genotype under the
	Hardy-Weinberg assumptions?

	What is the observed frequency of each genotype?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What do we mean by expected?

	If we flip a fair coin 100 times, what is the expected number of
	heads?

		What if we flip it 25 times?

	We don't expect to get exactly the expected value.

	The `expected value' is an average of what is expected under our
	assumptions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you know a coin is perfectly fair?

	You can never be sure that a coin is perfectly fair, you can only evaluate
	your evidence that it's more or less close to fair.

	Similarly, we never have evidence that a population is exactly in
	Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can only evaluate our evidence that
	it is not in equilibrium, or our evidence that it is close to
	equilibrium.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

	When do we expect genotype frequencies to behave like coins?

	Alleles selected at random from the previous generation:

		ANS Random mating within a closed population

		ANS No differences in fitness between genotypes

	If these assumptions hold, we expect [Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium]
	
		Hardy-Weinberg distribution, with no change in allele frequencies
		from generation to generation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Differences from equilibrium

	If we observe large differences from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 
	this is usually a sign that mating is not random, or that natural
	selection is operating

	The analysis tells us that something is going on, but not what

	Hardy-Weinberg is a [null model]: it tells us what to expect if
	complicating effects are absent

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reuniting | S26.4

	What happens when isolated populations come back into contact?

	Usually this happens when a geographic barrier disappears 
	
		a land bridge forms between an island and the continent

		a river changes course

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fusion

	When two isolated populations come into contact, they may [fuse] --
	go back together

		Adaptive differences may be small

		Adaptive differences may be overwhelmed by gene flow

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reinforcement

	In some cases, hybrid offspring may have low fitness

		ANS Incompatible alleles

		ANS Disruptive selection

	In these cases we expect natural selection for traits that
	[reinforce] the distinction between the two species

		They avoid mating, using coloration, timing, courtship rituals

Species divergence in allopatry | S26.2

	[Allopatry] refers to organisms living apart from each other

	If two populations are isolated from each other, we would expect
	that they might diverge.  Why?

		ANS Genetic drift
		
		ANS Natural selection

			ANS Different environments, or different adaptive mutations

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mechanisms of isolation

	Isolated populations of the same species can develop if some
	individuals [disperse] (move) to a new area and [colonize] it
	(establish a new population).

	Isolated populations of the same species can develop by [vicariance] -- when
	a population is split by a geographical or ecological barrier

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: ratites

	The ancestors of today's ostriches, emus, etc. were isolated when
	the super-continent of Gondwanaland drifted apart starting about 140
	million years ago

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Species divergence in sympatry | S26.3

	[Sympatry] refers to organisms living in the same geographic area

	In general, it should be hard for populations of the same species living in
	sympatry to diverge. 

		ANS Gene flow

	Divergence by partitioning habitats | Fig 26.10

		In some cases, gene flow will prevent divergence

	Divergence by genetic incompatibility 

		In some cases, one will drive the other extinct via competition

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Monophyletic group


	A [monophyletic group] is a group _defined by_ a single common
	ancestor

		All descendants of the ancestor must be in the group

	Monophyletic groups can also be called [clades] or [taxa].

	As biologists, we should try to think in terms of clades

		Are flying vertebrates a clade?

		What are some prominent groups that are not clades?

			ANS apes, reptiles, dinosaurs

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sister taxa

	Sister taxa can be a useful way of thinking about trees

		two taxa that share a common node

		You need to take the whole taxon, when appropriate

	E.g., sisters of: _Homo sapiens_; _Homo erectus_; humans?

		ANS _Homo neanderthalensis_; _Hn_ and _Hs_; _Paranthropus_

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading phylogenetic trees

	The tree indicates the pattern of branching of [lineages] (evolving
	lines)

	Tips are _assumed_ by the model to be monophyletic

	A tree is a model of how evolution occurred

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Morphological innovation

	A new adaptive mutation can open up further possibilities for adaptation

		[Hox gene] mutations allowed early animals to develop complex body plans

		The arthropod body plan
		
			insects, arachnids, crustaceans \ldots

		The {tetrapod} body plan
		
			reptiles, mammals \ldots

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hox genes | Fig 27.21

	[Hox genes] are involved in determining the identity of different
	body parts

	Taxa with simpler body structures tend to have fewer hox genes

		Phylogenetic comparisons provide important evidence that hox
		genes were involved in evolution of complex body plans

	Evidence that new hox genes were largely created by [gene
	duplication] events

		A kind of mutation; random change

		If it persists, it was selected for
