SEC Introduction | Chapter 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Ground rules

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expectations of students

	Print the notes from the web and bring them to class

	Don't talk while other students are talking, or while I am
	responding to student questions

	If you must talk at other times, be inobtrusive

	Don't use your computer in class

	If you must use your computer in class, be inobtrusive

		And don't connect to the internet

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expectations of professor

	Start and end on time

	Focus on conceptual understanding

	Make clear what terminology and facts must be learned

	Open to questions -- both in class (within reason) and at office
	hours

	Available by email and on Facebook

		I am not your friend

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure of presentation

	Required material will be clearly outlined in the notes

		ANS This is an answer: it was omitted from the notes for
		discussion purposes, you should probably write it in

		COMMENT This is a comment: I omitted from the notes because I
		thought it wasn't necessary for you to study

	Required terminology will be presented in [bold]

	General ideas and approaches presented in class may also be required;
	you should take notes on these in your own words

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why come to class?

	It's required

	Listening and thinking and talking will help you understand
	concepts, instead of just memorizing

	Details and terminology should be covered in sufficient detail in
	the notes; concepts may not be

	COMMENT You can't get your money back, so you may as well enjoy
	the show

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why read the book?

	It's interesting

	The book will explain some things in a better way (for you
	personally) than I do 

	Familiarity improves understanding

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking notes

	You will need to develop your own style of taking notes

		Many people benefit from writing things down, or using their own words

	If a new concept is making sense to you right now, write something
	that will help you remember

	If there's something I think you all need to write down, I will write
	it for you (or mark it as an answer)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation

	You are not responsible for details unless they are in the notes

		and not responsible for terminology unless it's in [bold]

	You _are_ responsible for relevant ideas and concepts from lectures
	and readings

	Conceptual questions, logical inference questions and application questions are fair game

		Practice questions will be available

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Thinking conceptually

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Deductive thinking

	Science proceeds by advancing hypotheses and comparing them to facts

	Facts can be observed from nature, or we can construct experiments
	to test specific hypotheses

	Basic, logical thinking is very simple, but it is often not easy for
	humans to think clearly about abstract concepts

		COMMENT Which is more complicated: Boolean algebra or hockey?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Example: cards and drinks

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RSLIDE Deductive thinking

	You go to a job interview, and are shown some playing cards.

	Some cards are face up, and you can see that they are aces or kings.

	Some cards are face down, and you can see whether they have bicycles
	or airplanes on the back

	The interviewer asks you to test the hypothesis that all of the aces
	have airplanes on the back

	Which of the four groups of cards do you need to turn over?

		ANS 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Deductive thinking

	You are the manager of a restaurant

	You can see some people's drinks clearly, and tell whether the
	drinks are alcoholic or not (but not the people's ages)

	You can see other people's faces clearly, and tell whether they are
	underage or legal-age (but not what they are drinking)

	You want to test the hypothesis that everything is OK:
	
		everybody who is drinking alcohol is of legal age

	Which of the four groups of people do you need to check out?

		ANS The underage people, and the alcohol drinkers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Deductive thinking

	You go to a job interview, and are shown some playing cards.

	Some cards are face up, and you can see that they are aces or kings.

	Some cards are face down, and you can see whether they have bicycles
	or airplanes on the back

	The interviewer asks you to test the hypothesis that all of the aces
	have airplanes on the back

	Which of the four groups of cards do you need to turn over?

		ANS The aces and the cards with bicycles on the back

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thinking conceptually

	Logical interpretation and inference is simple, but not always easy

		This is true for everyone

	Being on familiar ground helps us think clearly

		This will work for different people in different ways: learning
		facts, stories, mechanisms, etc.

	Practice clear thinking about simple questions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Logical inference

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inference

	Does the last statement _follow_ from the first two?

	Cats have four legs.  Mammals have four legs.  _Therefore_, cats are mammals

		ANS: Not a valid conclusion

	Cows can fly.  Dushoff is a cow.  _Therefore_, Dushoff can fly.

		ANS: Valid conclusion

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are simple things difficult?

	Probably because we've evolved to be good at certain kinds of
	thinking

	Example: training pigeons

		Pigeons can be trained to do remarkably complicated things with
		their bills to get food

		and with their feet to avoid electric shocks

		but not the other way around!

	Why does this make sense?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment: Logical equivalence

	Are these two statements logically equivalent?

		Tall people are mean

		Mean people are tall

	Are these two statements logically equivalent?

		Good food is not cheap

		Cheap food is not good

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Logical equivalence

	Statements are [logically equivalent] if they express the same fact in different words.  In other words, if either one is true, the other one must be true.

	Different people find it useful to think about logical equivalence in different ways

		Can you construct an example where one is true and the other is false?

		What would it take for each statement to be true?

		What would it take to falsify each statement?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC The cell theory | (pp.~2--3)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

All living organisms are composed of cells

BCC

SIDEFIG Pearson/01_01_vanLeeuwenhoek_L.jpg

NCC

	A [cell] is a highly organized compartment bounded by a membrane

	[Genes] made of [DNA]

	[Proteins] made of [amino acids]

	What about viruses?

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Where do cells come from?

	Are they generated spontaneously?

		If we leave damp bread out, molds just appear

	Do they come only from other cells?

		Then where did the first cells come from?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE The Pasteur experiment

FIG Pearson/01_02a_Pasteur_exprmnts_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE The Pasteur experiment

FIG Pearson/01_02b_Pasteur_exprmnts_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pasteur experiment

	Why was it necessary to have two flasks?

	What if the first flask had also failed to grow cells?

		ANS Maybe the broth wasn't the right kind to support growth of
		cells

		ANS Maybe the flask was somehow poisonous or discouraging

	Does this prove all cells come from cells?

		ANS Maybe cells can generate spontaneously under other conditions

		ANS \ldots, but that's not what's happening here

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Experimental design | (pp.~11--13)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hypotheses

	We pursue science by evaluating [hypotheses] (sing., hypothesis).
	These are proposed explanations of facts.

	We use hypotheses to make predictions, and use experiments and
	observations to attempt to [falsify] hypotheses -- to prove they are
	false.

		Most hypotheses cannot be _proved_ to be true, instead, if we fail
		to falsify them, we say that they are supported

		If a hypothesis explains many facts, and survives attempts at
		falsification, we tend to believe it

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: How do ants navigate through landscapes?

	Many species of ants move efficiently through landscapes while finding food
	and returning to their nests

	Mice tend to digest seeds (destroy them in their digestive system)

	Birds tend to excrete viable seeds after eating fruit

	Hypothesis: the spicy chemical in chili peppers deters mice, but not
	fruit-eating birds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Experiment: Ants finding their nest

	How do ants navigate through landscapes?

	ADD Fig

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Interpreting the results

	Are there other explanations?

	Do we think that ants count the way that we do?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Vitamin C 

	I want to find out whether Vitamin C is good for mice, so I raise a mouse on
	a standard diet, with Vitamin C supplement, to see whether it has a long,
	happy, healthy life.

	What is wrong with this experiment?

		ANS No comparison.  I don't know how the mouse would have done in the absence of the supplement

		ANS I only used one mouse.  I don't know if there was something unusual about it.

			ANS If we compare two mice, one will always do better than the other

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Control

	Good experiments are [controlled]: we have two or more groups that
	differ only in some factor we want to study

		flask neck, vitamin C

	Groups should be as similar as possible, except for the factor that we wish to study

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Replication

	Good experiments are [replicated]: each group has more than one [replicate]

		A replicate is a unit which is subjected to a chosen treatment
		mouse, a troop of baboons, a flask

	Replicates in the same group should not have anything in common (except for the factor we are studying)

		Replicates often planned first, then assigned randomly to groups 

	What if we put all the mice that get vitamin supplements in one
	cage, and the others in another cage?

		ANS We then have to worry about all possible differences
		between the two cages

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment: Car Trouble

	A brother calls his sister because something is wrong with his car

	She arrives, and they have this conversation:

		Sister: I have a tow hitch, and a tow rope, but I obviously can't tow you.

		Brother: That's OK, I can tow _you_!

		Sister: I guess so.  If we're careful.

	Each person drives their own car.  Nothing is wrong with the sister's car.  What is wrong with the brother's car?
