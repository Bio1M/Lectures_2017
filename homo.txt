CHAPTER Hominins

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Hominins | pp.~295-302

	[Hominins] refer to people and our upright ancestors

	Characterized by:

		Walking upright

		Specific changes in chewing design: teeth, jaws and skull

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Taxonomy | \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini}

BCC

SIDEFIG webpix/homininae.png

NCC

	Homonoidea, Hominidae, Hominininae, Hominini, Hominina, Homo

	Why so much detailed splitting?

		ANS We're a little bit full of ourselves

		ANS Observer bias

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Putting together the puzzle

	What did our common ancestor with chimpanzees look like?

	Which fossils are related to which other fossils?

	The key is which features are reliable indicators of relatedness?

		ANS How do we tell the difference between convergence and homology?

		ANS It's all in the details

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluating evidence

	There are a lot of theories and a great deal of expertise

	But expertise can also lead to over-confidence

	As with other examples, we try to make and test theories

		ANS Make predictions about things that haven't been seen yet

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Apelike ancestors | Fig 10.4-5

	Were our ancestors more like us, or more like apes?

		ANS We _are_ apes, if apes are a clade; both books make this mistake

			ANS They also make a similar mistake with hominoids

		ANS Among living apes, the closest _relatives_ of our ancestors is us

		ANS In some important ways, we have evolved more than chimpanzees have

		ANS But chimpanzees have probably evolved more than we assume

			ANS It is hard for us to study ourselves 

			ANS Observer bias

TSS Upright posture | Fig 10.11-12

	How did upright posture and upright walking evolve?
	
	It's not known, but there are many theories:

		Adaptation to walking on the ground instead of swinging through
		trees

			ANS If so, probably dependent on [gradual] evolution from
			existing form

		Adaptation for keeping cool

		Adaptation for harvesting food

		Adaptation for carrying food

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD Figs

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gradual evolution

	Hominins' evolution of upright posture was likely dependent on
	evolutionary history and circumstance

		Built on previous adaptations

	Evolution of upright posture almost certainly led to further
	evolutionary change:

		Carrying and storing things

		Making and using tools

	There should be lots of "loops" -- changes leading to other changes -- to
	explain how dramatically our ancestors evolved

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Studying evolution

	Evidence from fossils

		knees, hips, backs, skulls all provide evidence about posture

		teeth and jaws provide evidence about diet

	Evidence from archaeology

		hominin fossils may be found in particular placess
		
		associated with fossils from things that hominins used to eat

		or with tools

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Complex foraging | pp.~308--314

	A key part of human evolution was shaped by [complex foraging]
	strategies of our ancestors -- they relied on many types of food,
	including types of food that are difficult to get or process

	What adaptations likely favored this strategy?

		ANS Clever hands, upright walking

	What further adaptations might this strategy have favored?

		ANS Big brains

		ANS co-operation, including male-female co-operation

		ANS Social behaviour

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Back and forth evolution | Fig 10.4-5

	Very early hominins (6 mya) had facial and dental features that were similar
	to later hominins (2 mya)

		Less similar to chimpanzees

		But also less similar to _Australopiths_ (3 mya)

	Is this surprising?

		ANS Radiation and contraction

		ANS Changing conditions

			ANS Evolution is not goal-oriented

Hominin phylogenies | Fig 10.37

	Hominins had a large number of speciation and extinction events

		ANS Radiation and contraction

	The tree is not well understood, despite intensive study

		ANS Changing environments and convergent evolution

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDSLIDE

SEC Sociality

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex foraging and co-operation

	Complex foraging may have promoted co-operation between females and
	males, since primate child care is not well suited to a hunting life
	style

	It may have promoted co-operation between people with different
	skills, since they might have access to food at different times

	It may have promoted co-operation among hunters, since hunting success is
	highly variable

	It may have promoted co-operation in teaching and learning

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex foraging and thinking

	Complex foraging favors large brains that can learn a lot

	It also favors a long learning period

		Sensitivity vs.~crystallization

	It also favors communication

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex foraging and gender roles

	How might complex foraging affect child care and sexual dimorphism?

		ANS If males and females co-operate, then child care might be
		more equal

		ANS If child care is more equal, we expect sexual dimorphism to
		be less

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Social behaviour

	As behaviour becomes more social, a wide variety of other adaptations may become available

		Mostly related to thinking and communication

	Leading to more opportunities for looping:

		ANS Bigger brains may facilitate more food-gathering and survival
		strategies

		ANS Communication may favor co-operation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How social were early hominins?

	What kind of clues might be available?

		ANS Sexual dimorphism

		ANS Physical structures consistent with vocal communication

		ANS Dental enamel

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sexual dimorphism

	The extent of sexual dimorphism tells us at least something about social
	structures

		ANS Large amounts of sexual dimorphism probably mean less sociality and co-operation

		ANS At least among adult males

	How do we know whose bones are male and female?

		ANS [Pelvises] (hip bones) are very different in all of our ancestors

		ANS Because childbirth

	How do we know whose teeth are male and female?

		ANS We don't, usually

		ANS Bimodality can tell us about dimorphism anyway

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bimodality | Fig 10.9

	Bimodality means having two peaks in a distribution

		For example, a modern human height distribution would have a peak for
		men, and a peak for women

	If traits are strongly dimorphic, we should be able to tell by sampling, even if we don't know which teeth come from men and which from women

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD Picture

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Rate of development

	Why do human children develop _so_ slowly?

		ANS Presumably related to elaborate sociality

	We are therefore very interested in how long it took our ancestors to mature

	Some clues are available

		Dental enamel

		Molar development

	But it's a hard problem

TSEC Tool making

	Several species can make tools, but only people make tools that can project
	lectures directly from a computer onto a screen 

		COMMENT Which is awesome

	More broadly, hominins make far more sophisticated tools than non-hominins do

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other species

	What other animals make tools?

	Not counting programmed behaviours (spiky nests, ant traps)

		ANS Chimpanzees, orangutans

		ANS Elephants

		ANS Crows!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Looping

	Tool making is likely an important part of the "loop" that provided many
	opportunities for new adaptations along the hominin tree

	Others include:

		ANS Complex foraging

		ANS Sociality

		ANS Communication

	All these things probably interacted with and encouraged each other along
	the way

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Difficulties | Fig 11.2

	We find _amazing_ stone tools from 2-3.5 mya

		[Oldowan tools]

	It's hard to know who made them and used them

		ANS Stone keeps better than bone

	It's hard to figure out how they were used

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Active science | Closer Look 11.1

	Scientists have practiced _making_ and _using_ tools similar to the Oldowan
	tools

	Surprising conclusions:

		Cores are made by striking off flakes

			Flakes are surprisingly useful 
			
			cores may just be leftovers

		Spheroids may be discarded hammers

		Tool makers were mostly right-handed

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Tools and adaptation

	Tools opened up new strategies that likely favored co-operation,
	communication and culture:

		Hunting and scavenging with weapons

		Advanced foraging

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Active science | pp. 270-273

	Scientists lived with, and attempted to learn from, remaining forage-based
	societies

		Skills are very detailed, and take a long time to develop

		Possible support for looping with culture and language

	What can we learn from modern humans about our ancestors?

		ANS It's complicated

		ANS A lot of evolution has happened since then, and it's hard to figure out which parts are how relevant

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scavenging

	[Scavenging] is eating meat that is found, or taken from predators

	Evidence of early hominins [butchering] large animals including elephants
	raises the question of whether they were hunting or scavenging

		It's not so easy to kill an elephant

		Could they have had techniques or tools we don't know about?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scavenging and hunting

	Scavenging and hunting are complementary activities

		Most hunters scavenge

		Most mammalian scavengers hunt

	Our ancestors probably did both

	Scavenging requires the ability to:

		Take kills from other predators, or

		Use resources others can't use

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools for scavenging and hunting

	Some tools may have been used as weapons

		For killing prey, or for fighting off other carnivovers

		There is no evidence of this

	Tools could be used to process leftovers

		ANS Cracking large bones for marrow, for example

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools for complex foraging

	Tools and knowledge can make a wide range of food sources available

		Colonial insect resources

		Deeply buried plant resources

		Poisonous things that can be processed

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Humans

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Radiation and contraction

	Early humans replaced other hominins starting about 2 mya

	Modern humans replaced other humans starting about 0.2 mya

		ANS Probably through competition

		ANS But we still don't know all of the reasons

	Both early and modern humans evolved in Africa and spread from there

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Early humans | Fig 12.8

	Acheulean industry lasted almost 1 million years

	It took people longer to move on from Acheulean industry than to move from
	Acheulean industry to self-driving cars!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern humans

	Characterized by small face and teeth

	Less robust skeletal structure

	Evolved in Africa around 200 [kya] (thousand years ago)

	Took over most of the world in the last 50,000 years

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are we here?

	Modern humans arose around 200 kya, but took over the world around 50
	kya

	What happened?

		A sudden evolutionary change?

		Gradual evolutionary change?

			ANS Why don't we see evidence?

			ANS Might be about our brains, and not reflected in fossils

		A sudden cultural change?

		Gradual cultural change?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

	People evolved by the same basic rules as other organisms

		ANS Adaptation by natural selection

	Followed a very different path

		ANS Strong loops that continually created new adaptive opportunities

	There is a lot we can learn about ourselves from biology

		ANS We are affected by all of the same basic processes as other organisms

	And also a lot that we can't learn

		ANS We are also strongly affected by our complex brains (and complex
		cultures)
