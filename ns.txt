TSEC Evolution

	The theory of [evolution] has replaced the theory of [special
	creation] in science.

	The theory of special creation asserts that each species is a unique
	``type", created by God.

	The theory of evolution asserts that species have changed through time ([evolved]).

	Does this mean that scientists don't believe in God?

		ANS Many scientists do believe in God

		ANS Scientists learn about the world through experiment and
		observation

		ANS Scientists don't treat religious texts as _literally_ true

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Change through time | (pp.~484--486)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fossils

	A [fossil] is a physical trace of an organism that lived in the past

	Fossils can be dated using (complicated) radiometric and geological
	techniques

	Fossils provide information about the history of life (see Chapter
	27)

	The [fossil record] refers to the collection of all known fossils

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Extinction

	Many fossils have been left by organisms that are no longer around

		We say such organisms are [extinct]

	Extinction is one piece of evidence that species are changing

		COMMENT But not very convincing evidence!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Transitional forms

	When a species disappears from the fossil record, a similar species
	often appears

		This often happens in the same geographic area

	Consistent with species evolving: changing through time

	Fig 24.4

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Vestigial traits

	A [vestigial trait] is a structure that has no function, but is
	similar to functioning structures in related species
	
	Examples?

	Fig. 24.5

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Directly observed evolution

	Although much evolution occurs very slowly, some kinds of evolution
	can be, and have been, observed on faster time scales

		Peppered moths

		Ground finches | (pp.~493--495)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Relationships between species | (pp.~486--489)

	If species evolved from a common ancestor, we expect to see evidence
	that they are related to each other

		Species fall naturally into groups

			COMMENT: e.g., mammals, flowering plants

		Geographic patterns of relatedness

		Homology

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Geographic relationships

	Species in the same geographic area (e.g., nearby islands) often seem
	to be closely related

	This is what we would expect if these species evolved independently,
	starting from a common ancestor in the region

	Support for the theory of evolution

	Fig.~24.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution and similarity

	In nature we observe many, often surprising, similarities between
	organisms

		Almost identical developmental genes in fruit flies and
		people

		Similar limb bone structure in turtles and people

	The theory of evolution explains these similarities as [homologies]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Homology

	A [homology] is a similarity that is due to common ancestry

		Similarities apparently due to homology are widespread.  This is a
		strength of the theory of evolution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Genetic homology

	[Genetic homology] is homology at the level of genetic coding.

	Examples:

		The genetic code itself is shared (with rare, minor exceptions) by
		all living organisms

		Some genes involved in development are very similar all the way
		from insects to mammals

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Developmental homology

	[Developmental homology] is homology in the traits of [embryos]
	(developing organisms)

		Embryos of all vertebrates show striking similarities

		Fig 24.8

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structural homology

	[Structural homology] is homology at the level of developed
	organisms.

		Example: animal limbs

		Fig. 24.9

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Identifying homologies

	A tricky subject

		How do we know whether similarities are due to common evolution?

		Homologies assume evolution; how can they be used as evidence for
		evolution?

	The idea that many similarities are due to homology seems to explain
	many observed patterns

		Organisms fall naturally into groups

		Genetic evidence and morphological evidence often agree

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Natural selection

	Darwin's big idea was not evolution, but natural selection

	The first real theory of evolution was developed by Lamarck

		More famous for being wrong about how evolution occurs

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Natural selection drives evolution

	Darwin's theory of natural selection can be explained using four
	logical steps:

		[Variation:] The individuals that make a population vary in the
		[traits] they possess, like size, shape, physiological details.

		[Heritability:] Some of these differences can be inherited by
		offspring.  For example, tall people may be more likely to produce
		tall offspring.

		[Differential _reproductive_ success:] In each generation, some
		organisms leave more offspring than others

		[Selection:] Reproductive success is not random, but
		is influenced by differences in traits, including heritable traits

	If all four of these assumptions hold, we expect evolution to occur.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Natural selection (short version)

	Evolution by natural selection will occur if there is:

		Heritable [variation] in traits

		[Selection] (i.e., differential reproductive success) based on
		these traits

			Survival is one component of reproductive success; if you
			don't survive, you can't reproduce.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fitness

	[Fitness] in biology, or [Darwinian fitness], means simply an
	ability to do well under natural selection

	Fitness is thus defined as average reproductive success, given a
	suite of heritable traits

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Peppered moths

	Fig. 24.10

	What if there were no variation?

		Where does variation come from?

	What if variation were not heritable?

	What if there were no selection?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other examples

	Tuberculosis bacteria evolving drug resistance

		Fig 24.11

	Galapagos finches beak sizes evolve as availability of seed
	resources changes.

	See book!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Activity

	How would you design an experiment to tell if moth color is
	heritable?

		ANS Raise offspring from different combinations of mothers and
		fathers, and compare their colors

		ANS You might also want to try raising them in different
		conditions (i.e., white logs, black logs, artificial cages)

		ANS [Replicate].  Repeat the experiment with different offspring
		(using different mothers and fathers).

		ANS [Control].  Make all factors except for the color of mothers and fathers as similar as possible

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC The nature of adaptation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other models

	Natural selection is not the only possible model for how evolution
	could occur

		Inheritance of acquired characteristics

		Goal-directed evolution

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inheritance of acquired characteristics

	This is the idea that individuals change in response to their
	environment, and pass those changes on to their offspring

		Example: giraffes reaching for food

	It is now known that while individuals do often change in response
	to their environment, such changes are not (usually) passed on to
	offspring

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal-directed evolution

	This is the idea that organisms evolve towards specific goals

		Complex, multicellular organisms

		Big-brained humans

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluating competing hypotheses

	We challenge hypotheses with experiments and observation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inheritance of acquired characteristics

	Raise a population of mice in the lab

	Every generation stretch (or chop off) their poor little tails

	Measure natural tail length at the beginning of the experiment, and
	after 100 generations.

	How could this experiment be improved?

		ANS Add a control group

		ANS Use replicate populations (e.g., three control and three
		experimental populations)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Activity

	What would be the key points of a similar experiment to test whether
	tail lengths respond to natural (actually, artificial) selection?

		ANS In each generation, allow mice with longer (or shorter) tails
		more chances to breed

		ANS Compare results with a control population.

			ANS Let them breed how they want?

			ANS Make couples, and choose 2 offspring from each?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal-directed evolution

	There is a great deal of observational evidence against
	goal-directed evolution:

		Vestigial traits

		Bidirectional evolution

			Finch beaks get larger, then smaller

			Birds gain, then lose, flying ability

			Things that become parasites may become much smaller and
			simpler

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Adaptation vs.~acclimation

	[Acclimation] is the ability of organisms to respond directly 
	to their environment

		When organisms [acclimate] this does not affect the 
		traits of their offspring

	[Adaptation] is genetic change that increases the fitness of
	organisms

		Adaptation does not occur as a direct response to the environment

		Adaptation is usually very slow

		Adaptations are passed on to offspring, and form the basis of
		evolutionary change

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

	If you exercise every day, you will be stronger, but this will not
	make your children stronger.  
	
		ANS acclimation

	After swinging through trees for millions of years, chimpanzees
	have very strongly built arms.  
	
		ANS adaptation

	Polar bears have thick fur, and thick layers of fat under their
	skin.  
	
		ANS adaptation

	Humans raised in hot climates have more sweat glands than those
	raised in cold climates.  
	
		ANS acclimation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Acclimation

	Why do we acclimate?

		ANS It has probably evolved because acclimation is beneficial

	Are responses to changed conditions always good?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The good of the species

	Selection operates on individuals; individuals are not adapted to act
	for the good of the species

	The evolution of co-operation always involves tension between what is
	good for the group, and what is good for the individual

		If `cheating' strategies can evolve, they will

		A [cheater] benefits from co-operation, but does not participate

	Do lemmings commit suicide?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tradeoffs

	Much of adaptation is the result of compromise between conflicting
	goals

		Brightly colored individuals are more attractive to mates, and to
		predators

		Larger individuals compete more effectively, but are less
		efficient at reproducing

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical constraints

	Evolution proceeds by small steps

		What is possible is guided by what has gone before

	Examples

		Vestigial traits

		Blind spot in the vertebrate eye

		Humans are not well designed to be upright

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution by natural selection -- Summary

	There is strong evidence that species have evolved through time

		Fossil record, patterns of relatedness, homologies

	There is strong evidence that this change is driven by natural
	selection

		Darwin's logical postulates: heritable variation in traits;
		differential reproductive success based on traits

		Direct observations of natural selection (TB, finches, moths)

	Natural selection by (gradual) evolution imposes important
	constraints

		Species are not perfectly adapted
