----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Phylogeny | (pp.~543-548; B3--B5)

	Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of a group of organisms

	Based on the idea that organisms are related by evolution

	Understanding these relationships is critical to our understanding
	of both evolution, and how biological processes work

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Phylogenetic trees

	A [phylogenetic tree] is a model of how a group of organisms
	descended from a common ancestor

	The model consists of [nodes], where groups split, [branches] where
	evolution occurs, and [tips] representing observed [taxa] which are
	the endpoints of the process we are trying to model.

	A point where more than two branches diverge is called a _polytomy_.

		Polytomies mean we don't know which event happened first.

	Figures BS2.1, BS2.2

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Monophyletic group

	A [monophyletic group] is a group _defined by_ a single common
	ancestor

		All descendants of the ancestor must be in the group

	Monophyletic groups can also be called [clades] or [taxa].

	As biologists, we should try to think in terms of clades

		Are flying vertebrates a clade?

		What are some prominent groups that are not clades?

			ANS apes, reptiles

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading phylogenetic trees

	The tree indicates the pattern of branching of [lineages] (evolving
	lines)

	Tips are _assumed_ by the model to be monophyletic

	A tree is a model of how evolution occurred

		Trees that correspond to the same model are considered equivalent
		(Figure BS2.3)

	How do we judge how closely related two organisms are, according to a
	tree?

		ANS By looking for their common ancestor

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Constructing phylogenetic trees

	First, measure [characteristics] (or [characters]) of the taxa of
	interest -- i.e., anything that seems useful to measure

		Can be [morphological] (i.e., physical) or genetic

	Then infer (make an educated guess about) the phylogenetic
	relationships.

		[Phenetic] approaches use measures of distance between organisms

		[Cladistic] approaches are based on modeling how evolution occurs
		on the tree

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Morphological vs. genetic characteristics

	Should we use morphological or genetic characteristics to infer phylogenies?

		We usually have more information from genetic characteristics, and
		this information is easier to measure precisely

	When should we use morphological characteristics?

		ANS When genetic information is not available

		COMMENT Some viruses evolve so fast that morphological
		characteristics _may_ be more stable than genetic
		characteristics in some cases!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Phenetic vs. cladistic analysis

	Cladistic analysis makes use of the phylogenetic model of organisms
	evolving from each other to infer phylogenies

	Phenetic analysis ignores the phylogenetic model of organisms
	evolving from each other while inferring phylogenies

	Which is better?

		ANS Cladistic analysis

	When should we use the other one?

		ANS When our data are only distances, with no characters available
		-- e.g., certain molecular techniques

		COMMENT Sometimes phenetic techniques are used for
		computational convenience -- this can be dangerous

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Synapomorphies

	Classical cladistic analysis is based on [synapomorphies] -- shared,
	[derived] characters -- as evidence that two taxa are related

	Why do we focus on derived characters?

		ANS Because derived characters correspond to changes we must
		explain with our evolutionary model (phylogeny)

		COMMENT Example: flight in oaks, birds, fish

		COMMENT Example: flight in mosquitoes, birds, fish

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What characters are derived?

	Derived compared to what?

		The common ancestor (characteristics of the common ancestor are
		called [basal] characters).  

			COMMENT Example: ostriches, hawks, sparrows

		A [derived] character is a character not shared by the common
		ancestor of the group that we are currently thinking about

		One way to think about cladistic vs.~phenetic analysis is that
		phenetic analysis treats derived and basal characters equally

		COMMENT You are not responsible for the (confusing) idea of basal
		and derived _groups_.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inferring the common ancestor

	We want to know what the common ancestor was like, so we can tell
	which characters are derived (as opposed to [basal])

	This can be done sometimes by common sense
	
	Inferring the common ancestor statistically is difficult, for
	technical reasons

		We can make use of an [outgroup] to study a
		group.  An outgroup is an organism closely related to, but
		outside, the group being studied.

		We assume that the the [root], or beginning, of the tree is where
		the outgroup branches from the group

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Confusing the phylogeny

	Two species may have the same trait because the trait evolved twice
	independently -- [convergent evolution]

		Flight, trees

	An organism may lack a character that its ancestors had --
	[secondary loss]

		COMMENT This can be even more confusing

	Similarities that are not homologies (ie., not due to common
	ancestry) are called [homoplasies] (Fig.~27.2).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Parsimony

	Classical cladistic analysis is based on searching for the tree that
	can explain the observed data most [parsimoniously] -- with the
	fewest number of changes necessary.

	How do we address the problem of convergent evolution and homoplasy?

		ANS Make use of many different characteristics, when possible

		ANS It may also help to use many different taxa

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRA Likelihood

	Parsimony is the assumption that the most parsimonious (simplest)
	explanation is the most likely

	Modern cladistic analysis may use parsimony or likelihood methods

	Likelihood methods are often used for genetic data: they use models
	to explicitly estimate which explanation is most likely

	You do not need to know this

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Example: the evolution of whales

	Whales seem, on the surface, to be pretty different from other
	mammals, including their own group, the artiodactyls

	Whales lack the distinctive artiodactyl ankle structure (surprise!)

	Cladistic analysis eventually showed that whales are closely related
	to hippos (many synapomorphies)

	What about phenetic analysis?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tree-construction analysis

	Hippos have derived characters A, B, C, D, Z

	Cows have derived character A, Z

	Whales have derived characters B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, Z

	Calculate distances, and make a phenetic tree

	List synapomorphies, and make a cladistic tree

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tree discussion

	What is the effect of universal characteristics (like Z, above)?

		ANS None

	What is the effect of unique characteristics (like E, F, G, H, I)

		ANS They affect phenetic trees, but not cladistic trees

		ANS As long as we are sure that they are derived!

	Why might whales have more derived characters than the other species?

		ANS Because they have had to adapt more since moving to the water

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lessons

	Phenetic analysis can be misleading

	Any analysis can be misleading, if data are limited

		This is almost always a concern

	Inferences about the common ancestor can be crucial

		What if we thought E, F, G, H and I were all basal characters?

			ANS We would conclude that cows are closely related to hippos

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Phylogenetic trees are approximations!

	Phylogenetic trees are tremendously useful and powerful tools for
	organizing, understanding and analyzing biological data

	But they have limitations:

		The true history of life cannot really be summarized by a tree

			Sex, endosymbiosis

		Trees constructed by humans are not necessarily even the best
		approximations to the true history of life (and our guesses may
		change over time)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC The fossil record | (pp.~548--551)

	A [fossil] is a physical trace of an organism from the past

		Intact fossils retain their form and substance

		Compression fossils are squashed into a thin film

		Cast fossils occur when the decomposing piece is replaced by
		minerals different from the surrounding ones

		Permineralized fossils occur if minerals infiltrate cells as
		they are decomposing

	COMMENT Does any of this seem likely?

	Figure 27.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Biases in the fossil record

	Scientists have learned a lot from studying fossils, but care is
	needed.  Very few things fossilize, and some things are much more
	likely to fossilize than others, for example:

		Things that live in swampy areas, or underground ([Habitat bias])

		Hard things, or hard parts of things ([Taxonomic bias])

		Things that lived more recently have had less time to be
		destroyed, or to be buried too deep for recovery ([Temporal bias])

		Things that are more abundant have more chances to be preserved
		([Abundance bias])

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Accounting for biases 

	Because the fossil record is biased, scientists must be very careful
	about making inferences from what they see

		Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean that it wasn't there

		Just because you see a lot, doesn't mean that there were a lot
		(relatively speaking)

	Trying to figure out what happened based on what kind of fossils we
	happen to find is tricky

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC The timeline of life | (pp.~550-553)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Putting the timeline together

	Dates of specimens can be inferred using radioactive isotopes (harder than it sounds)

	Geologic inferences can be made about the relative age of
	different things (for example, if one was deposited on top of
	another).

	Molecular clocks are based on inferences about how fast things are
	evolving

	These techniques are complicated, and making the timeline is a
	difficult and exciting puzzle

TSEC Using history to understand biology

	Biologists combine information about:

		evolutionary history

		genetic composition

		structure and function

	as an important tool to figure out how organisms work

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hox genes

	[Hox genes] are involved in determining the identity of different
	body parts

	Taxa with simpler body structures tend to have fewer hox genes

		Phylogenetic comparisons provide important evidence that hox
		genes were involved in evolution of complex body plans

	Evidence that new hox genes were largely created by [gene
	duplication] events

	Figure 27.10

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gene duplication

	One or more genes may be accidentally duplicated so that the genome
	has two copies of each gene

	This may make the organism less efficient, and thus be selected
	against

	It may also allow for innovation.  Why?

		ANS Because one copy can continue to do the old function, while
		the other evolves a new function

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Evolutionary ecology

	Studying the history of life also provides information about how
	organisms evolve to fill (and create) ecological niches

	In many different cases, a new kind of organism has colonized an
	area, and diversified rapidly

		What is the same, and what is different, between similar cases?
