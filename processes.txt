----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution by natural selection

	Is something missing from the story I told last chapter?

		Heritable [variation] in traits

		[Selection] (i.e., differential reproductive success) _based on_
		these traits

	ANS Where does heritable variation in traits come from?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some genetics

	Our basic traits are determined by [genes]

	A location where a gene can occur is called a [locus] (pl.~[loci])

	A particular version of a gene is called an [allele]

	Complex organisms usually have two alleles at each locus

		These can be the same, or different

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Loci

	Complex organisms usually have two alleles at each locus

		These can be the same, or different

	An organism with different alleles at a particular locus is referred
	to as [heterozygous] (adj., n. form heterozygote)

	An organism with two copies of the same allele at a particular locus
	is referred to as [homozygous] (adj., n. form homozygote)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Two definitions of evolution

	_Lecture_: heritable changes in species traits over time

	_Book_: changes in allele frequencies

	These definitions are consistent; use the one which helps you think
	clearly

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Analyzing genotype frequencies | S25.2

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Genotypes and phenotypes

	A [genotype] is the collection of an individual's genes

	A [phenotype] is the collection of an individual's physiological and
	physical traits

		What we can observe about an individual

		Phenotype is largely (but by no means entirely) determined by
		genotype

Example: peppered moths

	NOTES Check ``peppered moths'' or ``Kettlewell's experiment'' on wikipedia

	Two different alleles possible at the wing color gene: $A_1$
	and $A_2$.

		Individuals with $A_1	A_1$ _genotype_ have light-winged
		_phenotype_

		Individuals with $A_2	A_2$ _genotype_ have dark-winged
		_phenotype_.

		Individuals with $A_1	A_2$ _genotype_ ???

	If individuals with genotype $XY$ have the same phenotype (on
	average) as those with $XX$, we say that $X$ is a [dominant] allele
	and $Y$ is a [recessive] allele.  

	If $XY$ individuals have an intermediate phenotype (between $XX$ and
	$YY$, we say $X$ and $Y$ are [co-dominant].

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Analyzing genotype frequencies

	We analyze genotype frequencies as follows:

		Make simple assumptions about how frequencies work

		Calculate [expected frequencies] under our assumptions

		Measure [observed frequencies] in the population

		Look for evidence of systematic (not random) difference between
		expected and observed frequencies

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Making simple assumptions

	Expected frequencies are usually calculated by assuming that alleles
	assort randomly and independently, like flipping two coins, or
	rolling two dice

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Coin flipping

	I flip two fair coins (ie., each coin will land heads with
	probability 1/2).

	What is the probability of:

		Two heads

		Two tails?

		One of each?

	ANS 1/4, 1/4, 1/2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Professional coin flipping

	A professional gambler can flip a coin so that it lands heads 70\% of
	the time.  She flips two coins.

	What is the probability of:

		Two heads

		Two tails?

		One of each?

	ANS 0.49, 0.09, 0.42

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardy-Weinberg distribution

	The Hardy-Weinberg distribution is the distribution expected if
	alleles work like coins (random and independent).

	If $p$ is frequency of allele $A_1$ and $q$ is frequency of allele
	$A_2$, then:

		Frequency of genotype $A_1	A_1$ is $p^2$.

		Frequency of genotype $A_2	A_2$ is $q^2$.

		Frequency of genotype $A_1	A_2$ is $2pq$.

	Why the 2?

		ANS Because you could get $A_1$ from Mom and $A_2$ from Dad,
			or $A_1$ from Dad and $A_2$ from Mom
			\ldots two ways to do it

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: calculating allele frequencies

	I collect 20 peppered moths from a particular place, and find that 4
	have genotype $A_1	A_1$, 8 have genotype $A_1	A_2$, and 8 have
	genotype $A_2	A_2$.

	What is the observed frequency of each allele?

	What is the expected frequency of each genotype under the
	Hardy-Weinberg assumptions?

	Is this population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

		ANS We see more homozygotes than expected

		ANS But is this reliable evidence?  That's a question for statistics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What do we mean by expected?

	If we flip a fair coin 100 times, what is the expected number of
	heads?

		What if we flip it 25 times?

	We don't expect to get exactly the expected value.

	The `expected value' is an average of what is expected under our
	assumptions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you know a coin is perfectly fair?

	You can never be sure that a coin is perfectly fair, you can only evaluate
	your evidence that it's more or less close to fair.

	Similarly, we never have evidence that a population is exactly in
	Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can only evaluate our evidence that
	it is not in equilibrium, or our evidence that it is close to
	equilibrium.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

	When do we expect genotype frequencies to behave like coins?

	Alleles selected at random from the previous generation:

		ANS Random mating within a closed population

		ANS No differences in fitness between genotypes

	If these assumptions hold, we expect [Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium]
	
		Hardy-Weinberg distribution, with no change in allele frequencies
		from generation to generation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Differences from equilibrium

	If we observe large differences from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 
	this is usually a sign that mating is not random, or that natural
	selection is operating

	The analysis tells us that something is going on, but not what

	Hardy-Weinberg is a [null model]: it tells us what to expect if
	complicating effects are absent

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Example: Human blood groups

WIDEFIG Pearson/F26_processes/TB26_1_MN_blood_groups_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Human blood groups

	MN blood groups in different human populations are very close to
	Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium | Table 25.1

		No evidence for non-random mating, or for fitness differences.

	What about MN blood groups in the global human population?

		ANS They are not in equilibrium, because mating is not random 

		ANS More homozygotes than expected

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Example: Human HLA genes

WIDEFIG Pearson/F26_processes/TB26_2_HLA_genotypes_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Human HLA genes | Table 25.2

	HLA genes are used by the immune system to recognize disease-causing
	organisms

	Researchers hypothesized that heterozygous individuals may
	recognize more bacteria and viruses

	Data shows that more people are heterozygous for HLA genes than
	would be expected under the Hardy-Weinberg assumption

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Heterozygous HLA genes

	Why might more people be heterozygous for HLA genes than predicted
	by Hardy-Weinberg?

		ANS Heterozygous people might be more likely to survive

		ANS Heterozygous people may have more offspring

			COMMENT Effects of this one are more complicated

			COMMENT Heterozygotes don't necessarily have heterozygous
			offspring

		ANS People might be more attracted to people with different HLA
		types

			ANS Maybe _evolved_ this way because of reasons above

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Types of natural selection | S25.3

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Directional selection

	[Directional selection] tends to move a population in a particular
	direction

		Giraffe necks

		Human brains

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Cliff swallow example

FIG webpix/swallows.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Cliff swallow example

FIG Pearson/F26_processes/26_05b_directional_select_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Multi-directional selection

	Directional selection can change through time with the environment

		Swallows may get larger during extreme cold spells, smaller again
		during normal weather

			But we need to know whether the changes we saw were heritable

		Finch beaks get thicker when food is scarce, and smaller when
		food is abundant 

		Why might small-beaked finches have advantages?

			ANS Lots of reasons!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Stabilizing selection

	[Stabilizing selection] tends to keep the population where it is

		Example: human birthweights | Fig 25.4

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Stabilizing selection

FIG Pearson/F26_processes/26_06b_stabilizing_select_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Connections between selection types

	What happens if the target of directional selection stays the same
	for a long time?

		ANS The population arrives at the target, and directional
		selection becomes stabilizing selection

	Examples?

		ANS Giraffe necks

		ANS Human brains

		ANS Almost everything

			ANS at any given time

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Disruptive selection

	Disruptive selection favors phenotypes _different_ from the average
	value | Fig 25.5

		Black-bellied seedcrackers

		Animals that get eaten a lot may want to look different from
		their peers

	Disruptive selection may lead to [speciation] -- the formation of
	new species.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Other evolutionary mechanisms

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Genetic drift

	[Genetic drift] is change in allele frequencies due to random
	sampling:

		Some individuals have more offspring than others due to chance events

		Offspring receive certain parental alleles, and not others

	These factors will lead to an accumulation of random changes in
	allele frequencies

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thought experiment

	Imagine flipping a fair coin 100 times

		Repeat

	Now imagine choosing 100 alleles at random (with replacement) from a
	population of 50 $A$ and 50 $B$ alleles

		Repeat, using new population as a starting point | Fig 25.6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Genetic drift

Population 400

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Genetic drift

Population 4

FIG Pearson/F26_processes/26_12_1_genetic_drift_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Small populations

	Drift is much stronger in small populations than in large ones (law
	of averages).

	Even if a population is big now, it may have been small in the past

		[Founder effects] occur when a new population is started by a
		small number of individuals

		[Bottlenecks] occur when a population becomes small, then large
		again

			... or, when a new genetic mutation takes over a population

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixation and loss

	An allele may drift to a frequency of 0 (it's [lost]) or of 1 (it's
	[fixed])

	Advantageous alleles are often (not always) fixed

	Disadvantageous alleles are usually (not always) lost

	COMMENT The opposite may happen, at random, in small populations

	Alleles with [neutral] differences (no selective difference) will be
	fixed or lost at random

	Drift tends to reduce genetic variation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Gene flow | S25.4

	[Gene flow] is the movement of alleles from one population to another

		This happens when individuals move from one population to another
		and breed

	How we think about gene flow depends on how we choose to define a
	`population'

	Gene flow can be an obstacle to speciation; it helps keep
	populations similar

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Mutation | S25.5

	[Mutations] are heritable errors in copying DNA

	Mutations are rare; by themselves they don't cause much evolution

	Mutations are extremely important to evolution, however:

		ANS Mutations provide the variation on which natural selection
		acts

		ANS Mutation is the only source of new alleles

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mutations are random

	Most mutations are [deleterious] -- bad for fitness

	Very rarely mutations are [beneficial] -- good for fitness

		Such mutations are favored by natural selection

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex organisms

	Can complex organisms arise through random mutations?

		A central question of biology

		Large-scale evolution takes a _long_ time

		Beneficial changes can accumulate gradually

		Much evidence of intermediate forms

	NOTES Check out videos of ``evolution of the eye''

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about sex?

	Sex as an evolutionary process is very complicated

		ANS Still active debate on the advantages and disadvantages of sex

	Sex does act to bring alleles together (and to split them apart)

	Sex does not provide a source of new alleles

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Mating patterns

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Inbreeding

	[Inbreeding] refers to mating between close relatives

	Since relatives will tend to share similar alleles, inbred
	populations will tend to differ from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
	what way?

		ANS More homozygous loci

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inbreeding depression

	In many populations, it is observed that inbred individuals have
	lower fitness:

		They are more likely to be homozygous for rare genetic defects

		They are less likely to be heterozygous for immune-system genes

	Inbreeding depression is a serious concern for conservation

		As populations get smaller, inbreeding becomes more common

	Human demographic studies show strikingly lower survival for children of first cousins | Table 25.4

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Sexual selection

	[Sexual selection] is a form of natural selection

	Occurs when there is heritable variation in traits related to
	success in obtaining mates

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: zebra finches

	Males but not females have colorful orange beaks

	Hypothesis: these beaks make males more attractive to females | Fig 25.17

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Zebra finches

FIG Pearson/F26_processes/un/26_08a_zebra_finch_beaks_U.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Zebra finch experiments

	Feed some males enriched diets

		Their beaks become more orange

		They are preferred by females

	Why not simply find and use birds whose beaks are naturally more or less
	orange?

		ANS Orange-beaked birds may differ in other ways (bigger,
		healthier, etc.)

	What is a possible problem with the conclusion that females prefer
	birds with orange beaks?

		ANS The diet enrichment may have other effects 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE Finch results

FIG Pearson/F26_processes/26_08b_zebra_finch_beaks_L.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why the males?

	Males often have striking traits that females lack, used in
	courtship, or in battles for mates

		Sexual [dimorphism] refers to trait differences between males and
		females

	Why do males more often have these traits than females?

		Investment in reproduction

		Variation in reproductive success

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment in reproduction

	In many species, females invest much more in each offspring than
	males do

		Eggs are expensive, sperm are cheap

		Females are often more involved in caring for offspring

	If females invest a lot in each offspring, they can maximize fitness
	by _being choosy about mates_

	If males invest little in each offspring, they can maximize fitness
	by _mating as much as possible_

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing the theory of sexual selection

	How might we test the theory that males compete sexually because
	females invest more in offspring?

		ANS Are there any species where these roles seem to be reversed?

			ANS Yes, in some species of pipefish (related to seahorses)
			the males spend more time and energy caring for young them
			females

		ANS In these species, do females compete for males?

			ANS Yes, females are larger than males, and develop bright
			colors at courtship time

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSLIDE WIDEFIG webpix/pipefish.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Variation in reproductive success

	Males often have greater variation in reproductive success than
	females do

	This is a side-effect of the fact that females usually invest a lot
	in each offspring

		Reduces potential total number of offspring

		Makes females desirable to males

	Greater variation in reproductive success means that winning
	contests is more important to male than female fitness

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: elephant seals

	Male elephant seals compete for control of breeding beaches

	Huge variation in reproductive success

	Huge size difference between males and females (strong sexual dimorphism) | Fig 25.19

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What about people?

	Men and women have pretty clear size differences

	How unequal is child-rearing in people?

		ANS Not so unequal

		ANS But fathers are not always biological fathers

	To what extent do these principles even apply to people?

		ANS To _some_ extent

		ANS We have complicated brains, and complicated cultures
